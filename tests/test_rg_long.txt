ripgrep 13.0.0 Andrew Gallant <jamslam@gmail.com>

ripgrep (rg) recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By
default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden
files/directories and binary files.

Use -h for short descriptions and --help for more details.

Project home page: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep

Usage:
  rg <pattern> [<path>]...

Arguments:

  <pattern>
    A regular expression used for searching. To match a pattern beginning with a
    dash, use the -e/--regexp flag.

    For example, to search for the literal '-foo', you can use this flag:

        rg -e -foo

    You can also use the special '--' delimiter to indicate that no more flags
    will be provided. Namely, the following is equivalent to the above:

        rg -- -foo

  <path>
    A file or directory to search. Directories are searched recursively. File
    paths specified on the command line override glob and ignore rules.

Options:

  -A, --after-context=<NUM>
    Show NUM lines after each match.

    This overrides the --context and --passthru flags.

  --colors=<COLOR_SPEC>...
    This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may be
    provided multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively. Colors are
    limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow,
    white and black. Styles are limited to nobold, bold, nointense, intense,
    nounderline or underline.

    The format of the flag is '{type}:{attribute}:{value}'. '{type}' should be
    one of path, line, column or match. '{attribute}' can be fg, bg or style.
    '{value}' is either a color (for fg and bg) or a text style. A special
    format, '{type}:none', will clear all color settings for '{type}'.

    For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta
    and the background color for line numbers to yellow:

        rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.

    Extended colors can be used for '{value}' when the terminal supports ANSI
    color sequences. These are specified as either 'x' (256-color) or 'x,x,x'
    (24-bit truecolor) where x is a number between 0 and 255 inclusive. x may be
    given as a normal decimal number or a hexadecimal number, which is prefixed
    by `0x`.

    For example, the following command will change the match background color to
    that represented by the rgb value (0,128,255):

        rg --colors 'match:bg:0,128,255'

    or, equivalently,

        rg --colors 'match:bg:0x0,0x80,0xFF'

    Note that the the intense and nointense style flags will have no effect when
    used alongside these extended color codes.
